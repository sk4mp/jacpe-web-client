### Ideas / Goals
* Configure all your panels, pages, API calls and more on the go.
	* Drag and drop everything that fits.
* Allow users as much customization as possible.
	* Create a multitude of available elements — like buttons, input fields, image containers, graphs, tables and more.
* Allow usage without a back-end server by storing the config in the browser for people who do not want an additional server running.
* Support many different API "types" like *JSON*, *GraphQL*, and maybe even *WebHooks*.
* Make it look pretty.

### Usage
Just clone this repository and run `yarn install` to install all the needed dependencies.

Some other commands:
